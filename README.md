# App Profile Recommendation
## Description
In this project I will perform a data analysis on the free mobile apps world. 
More specifically, I'll use these two datasets provided by Kaggle:
- [Google Play Store Apps Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/home) for the Google Play data [Data collected in August 2018]
- [Mobile App Store ( 7200 apps)](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps/home) for the App Store data [Data collected in July 2017]

The aim of this project is to find the best category to generate earnings among free apps, whose source of revenue consists of in-app ads.
